    Tumblr allows 3rd party services like ours, to modify new & existing posts.<br/>
    You already allowed us to make modifications on your posts, when signed up with Tumblr.<br/>
    So all you need to do is finish this installation.<br/>
    <br/>
    We are not doing any modifications, of your posts without you knowing.<br/>
    <br/>
    We support only <strong>photo</strong> posts as of the moment, we'll be adding more post types soon.
